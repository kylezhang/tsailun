​​\+The C++ Web Framework (C\+WF) is a M\+VC web framework, Open Source, under M\+IT License, created by Herik Lima and Marcelo Eler, using C++ with Qt to be used in the development of web applications. The C\+WF was designed to consume few computational resources, such as memory and processing, and have a low response time for requests. With M\+VC (Model-\/\+View-\/\+Controller) architecture, you can create classes to take care of the business layer (Model), use C\+S\+TL (C++ Server Pages Standard Tag Library) within the Web Pages to take care of data presentation (View) and use the controllers as a between the two layers (\hyperlink{class_controller}{Controller}).

Because it is created in Qt, the C++ Web Framework can run on the same platforms supported by Qt\+:

Desktop\+: Linux, OS X, Windows Embedded and R\+T\+OS\+: Linux, Q\+NX, Vx\+Works, Windows Mobile\+: Android, i\+OS, Windows

The C\+WF has only one configuration file, called C\+P\+P\+Web.\+ini and a policy of using only C++ and Qt in the development of its components in order to avoid the installation of numerous libraries to avoid conflicts, maintain multiplatform characteristics, facilitate installation and keep the learning curve low in order to make web development as simple as possible, even for beginners.
